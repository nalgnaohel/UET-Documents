The requirements of the final exam is in slide Lecture 10 (I belive so). 

My solution the final exam is in the IEEE file (Stupid me, forgot to change the name of the template file :((). It was graded 9. Not too high (in this class, I was not able to got bonus point), but for a solo, perhaps it was not bad.

About the mid-term exam, it had 2 parts. The first part was multiple choice questions, there were 30 questions in the test. Unfortunately it was locked right after I took the test, so I cannot upload the questions here. The second part had 2 questions, the first one was about SVM, and the second one was about Regularized Linear Regression.
